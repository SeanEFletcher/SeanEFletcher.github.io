    <h2>Hello and welcome,</h2>
    <p>
        <br>

My name’s Sean. I created this website in order to showcase my computer programming projects. 
Continue reading here for a little bit about me and my decision to start coding, or just hop over and check out my projects. 
Thank you for visiting!
<br><br>
I earned a Bachelors of Arts degree in Linguistics from the University of Southern Maine back in 2014. 
After graduating I spent five years as a professional American Sign Language interpreter, 
and was fairly engaged with the profession. 
As an interpreter I developed and ran workshops, 
volunteered my time and services for various Deaf community events, 
and even served on the board of the Maine Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf as their recording secretary. 
<br><br>
After my fourth year in the profession I started becoming disenchanted. 
While interpreting is challenging, impactful, and extremely nuanced, I kept feeling like a “fly on the wall” at the majority of my assignments. 
I was interpreting for doctors/patients, students/teachers, employers/employees, etc… but was not the doctor or the patient. 
I was never teaching or learning something myself, and wasn't interacting with MY boss or MY employees. 
I was simply a conduit. 
If you’re doing a good job interpreting it’s almost as if you aren’t even in the room, 
and then after a job is completed you leave and often never learn what happened afterwards. 
Did I do a good job? Did some of the choices I made help or hurt any of my clients? 
It’s very hard to tell. 
I started taking coding classes at codecademy because I want a profession where I’m one of the agents in my own workday. 
I want to be able to express my opinion (something interpreters are encouraged NOT to do) and to build and work on things that last more than an afternoon.
<br><br>
When the pandemic hit I changed focus and have been a stay-at-home dad/house-husband for my wife and toddler. 
I have less free time in this role than I did while interpreting, but still dedicate time daily to learning to code. 
Spoken and signed languages have taken a back seat to computer programming languages, but I’m still using linguistics. 
Please drop me an email if you have any questions. Cheers
