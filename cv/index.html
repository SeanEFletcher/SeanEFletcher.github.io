        <p class="CVitemTitle"> <strong>Staff Interpreter,</strong> Pine Tree Society Interpreting Services, March 2017 - October 2020</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Worked as a flexible team member, covering and supporting other interpreters as needed; 
            worked in cooperation with the scheduling team to assure maximum job coverage and the transfer of pertinanat information from one interpreter to the next, 
            this was especially important for extended jobs such as a Deaf individual's surgery where interpreters were needed for the preparation classes, the surgery itself, and the recovery process (which all together could be weeks or even months); 
            used multiple platforms for billing, scheduling, and an emergency contact system, etc. (something about how the systems didn't talk to each other and I needed a systems understanding on each platform and the company to understand which information was necessary for wwhich system..?</li>
