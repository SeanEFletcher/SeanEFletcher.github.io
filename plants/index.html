        <p>
            I <strong>love</strong> succulents. They’re great if you have a hard time keeping plants alive.
            They’re also great if you’re a plant enthusiast! Really they're just great.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            But what <em>are</em> succulents exactly? Are they cacti? Are they trees?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            A succulent is any kind of plant that stores water in its leaves, stem/trunk, and roots in order to survive in arid climates.
            So ALL cacti are succulents, though not all succulents are cacti. There are even a few trees that are succulents.
            Here's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adansonia_grandidieri" target="_blank">Baobab</a> as an example.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Succulents are also <strong>SUPER</strong> popular these days.
            With our broken economy and millennials living in basements and tiny apartments succulents have become the <em>"go-to"</em> plants.
            <br>
            You don’t even need to visit a greenhouse or nursery anymore to buy one because grocery stores sell them too.
            But let’s be real; many people get clippings from friends.
            This works well because many succulents are easy to propagate!

        <h3>Checking for illness and infestation:</h3>
        <p>If you acquired a succulent already in a pot with soil: please quarantine it for a couple weeks before putting it on the shelf next to your other plants.
            This will give time enough to spot a problem before that problem finds its way to your other plants.
            If you're buying a succulent from a store, check the plant you want AND the other plants in the area for pests and fungi before you make your purchase.
            Here is a helpful guide from the Missouri Botanical Garden to help you know what to look for.
            <a href="https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/insects/mealybugs/insect-pests-of-cacti-and-succulents.aspx" target="_blank">THE GUIDE.</a>
            Or if it’s already too late, this guide can help you identify and approach the problem you’ve discovered.
            I hate mealy bugs. Here’s <a href="https://succulentsbox.com/blogs/blog/how-to-get-rid-of-mealy-bugs-on-succulents" target="_blank">another page</a>
            specifically on mealy bugs..
        </p>
        <br>
        <aside>
            I have personal experience with mealy bugs and fungus gnats.
            To keep the fungus gnats down let the soil dry out completely in between waterings. The larva can't live in dry soil,
            so allowing the soil to dry out completely will kill the larva and
            repeated cycles of drying out completely before watering again will eventually end the gnat infestation.
            <br>
            One fun way I’ve found to get rid of mealybug infestations can be attempted during the summer (I live in Maine, USA).
            I placed my mealybug infested jade (I really like this jade) outside in an area with a high occurrence of ants
            and the ants did all the cleaning for me! After the summer months were over I checked my jade over and found NO more mealybugs
            and haven’t seen one since!! Ha! Really helps them live up to their name huh? MEALybugs! I hope the ants enjoyed them.

                </figure>
                <h5>Sedums:</h5>
                Just clip a piece (3-6 inches long) off and let it sit in or on top of soil for a few weeks.
                It’s very important that the soil drains well, but keep it moist until you notice it has started producing roots.
                Then water as the soil completely drys out.

                </figure>
                <h5>Aloes:</h5>
                Propagating aloes can be done using an aloe leaf or a “pup”.
                If you’re using a leaf, place it in soil and wait for roots. Don’t keep the soil wet, just moist, and not too moist.
                Sometimes aloes put out “pups.” They’re little baby aloes that grow up around the outside of the larger aloe plant.
                When you collect a pup try to get as much of the roots as possible.
                This might mean replanting the whole aloe and collecting the pups in the process. But from here it’s a sinche.
                Just put the aloe pup in a small container and go. Remember to let it dry thoroughly before watering!

                <h5>Jades:</h5>
                It’s very important to let its wound dry completely before planting and/or watering it.
                If the cut-point isn’t allowed to dry before you start watering it then the wound won't be able to dry out and it will start to rot.
                The rot will eat its way up the cutting's stalk killing it.

                </figure>
                <h5>Christmas cactus:</h5>
                It’s SUPER easy to propagate a christmas cactus. Just clip off a branch.
                If the branch is thick then wait for the cut point to dry out (a day, maybe two days, don’t leave it in the sun).
                Place it in soil, and water lightly.
                Let the soil dry out fully before watering, and in about a month or so you should notice your new christmas cactus sprouting new leaf buds!

        <h3>Care:</h3>
        <p>
            Once you have your succulent, how do you go about caring for it?
            Is it true that you don’t have to water them?
        </p>
        <h5>Watering:</h5>
        <p>
            Oh no, you definitely need to water your succulents. The important thing is to not water too often.
            The fastest and by far most common way to kill a succulent is to over water it.
        </p>
        <h5>Soil:</h5>
        <p>
            Using any old kind of potting mix is a bad idea. Make sure you get a succulent/cactus mix, or even an african violet mix.
            The reasoning behind this is because those mixes will dry out faster and tend to have better draining.
            If a succulent's roots are left in very wet soil for too long they will rot and your succulent will die.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having a soil mixture that dries out quickly will allow the dry-completely and then water-thoroughly cycles to happen more frequently.
            This prevents fungi, it prevents gnats, it’s better for root growth which in turn helps keep your succulents vibrant and growing.
        </p>
        <h5>Container Selection:</h5>
        <p>
            Also make sure the pot isn’t too big for the succulent.
            You might think “the pot is a little big, but the succulent will grow into it”. That might be true. It might “grow into” the container.
            But all that extra currently-unnecessary soil will hold water longer, keeping your succulents’ roots wet, and if you’re not careful your succulent will die.
            It might seem unintuitive, but a smaller pot can actually help your succulent grow bigger, faster.
            A container that is the correct size will help the soil fully dry out faster, encouraging the roots to grow in search of water.
            This keeps the root mass healthy and active which in turn supports the body and leaves of the plant.
            These drying-out and then watering cycles are exactly what your succulent is looking for.
        </p>
        <aside>
            Some succulent enthusiast will basically plant their succulents in what looks like small pebbles and sand and maybe a little bit of pine bark or coconut husk.
            Basically gravel. And then water every day to every other day.
            That’s a little too much work for me though so I do add more organic components and water less frequently.
            I use pre-mixed succulent soils and tend to water my succulents once to twice a month.
            It depends on the plant and the location and the soil and the sun and the humidity and all those other things.

        <h3>The TWO golden rules:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h5>Let the soil dry out!</h5>
                <p>
                    Do not water the succulent until the soil has completely dried out.
                    You may think the soil is dry because the top layer looks dry, but either dig your finger into the soil about a knuckle or two in order to really tell.
                    My general rule is wait until I think the plant has dried out.
                    Then I wait at least a few more days or weeks even.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>The more sun the better!</h5>
                <p>
                    The more sunlight the better. Make sure your succulent gets at least a little direct sunlight.
                    It doesn’t even need to be that much honestly.
                    My wife has been keeping this aloe alive in a zero sunlight area of the house for over a year now…
                    I think it’s slowly dying though… I might have to go "save" it by moving it into a window… BUT!
                    Generally with succulents, the more sunlight the better!
